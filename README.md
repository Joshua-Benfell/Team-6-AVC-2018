- [x] Josh: CAD robot
- [x] Josh: Print parts
- [x] Jordan, Sam & Josh: Produce first prototype
- [x] Jordan & Sam: Refine prototype
- [x] Jordan & Sam: Get robot moving
- [x] Josh: Set up collaboration spaces (Onshape, Github, Google Drive, Discord)
- [x] Josh: Link all required areas to Github
- [x] Michael: Set up Bash Script for compiling on RPi

#### Week 1 Review (5th May 2018)
* Everyone has done their assigned tasks this week.
* We have set up goals for next week ([Week 2 Checklist](#week-2-checklist))
* Jordan didn't show up to first meeting outside lab but apologised due to parents being in town
* Jordan, Michael, Sam and Josh were at the lab this week and all were in and throughout afterwards
* Everyone who attended signed AVC plan and agreement

### Week 2 Checklist
- [x] Josh: Update Github with progress
- [x] Sam, Jordan: Assemble and test hardware
- [x] ~~Someone: Research PID~~
- [ ] ~~Michael: Set out how code is to be written (Style Guide)~~
- [x] Everyone: Implement and Test code for first two quadrants
- [ ] Everyone: Start on progress report

#### Week 2 Review (12th May 2018)
* We have not started on the progress report, so this is a priority goal for the next week
* We have met the big goal for this week and have implemented line following code for quadrants 1 and 2 ([testQ1.cpp](testQ1.cpp))
* We did not see the need for a style guide in the end
* We learnt about PID in lecture
* Hardware is almost done aside from a front mount for a final IR sensor, Jordan has expressed interest in designing this so that shall be his goal
* Michael did not come to the lab this week due to needing to study for his CYBR171 test
* Xian and Eris (Our other two members) have not shown up.
* Goals for [Week 3](week-3-checklist) have been set up
* We have collected 3 Long range IR sensors
* Michael has implemented the Networking Gate
* Pictures of robot have been uploaded

### Week 3 Checklist
- [x] ***IMPORTANT*** Everyone: Start and complete the progress report
- [x] Sam, Josh, Michael: Implement and test code for Quadrant 3
- [ ] Michael: Start on code for Quadrant 4
- [x] Jordan: Design a mount for front facing IR Sensor
- [x] Josh: Update the Github

#### Week 3 Review (19th May 2018)
* Everyone completed the progress report
* We managed to implement and test code for Quadrant 3, however, we did not complete it so did not progress to starting onto quadrant 4
* Everyone turned up to the scheduled lab time.
* Goals for [Week4](week-4-checklist) have been set up 
* Everyone met their goals, Michael was unable to start on quadrant 4 due to us not completing quadrant 3 as a group.
* We are a little bit behind our project timetable. Need to catch up next week

### Week 4 Checklist

- [ ] Michael, Josh: Complete Quadrant 4
- [ ] Jordan: print a switch mount
- [ ] Jordan: Design & Print a top plate
- [ ] Sam: Swap wheels out and reassemble hardware
- [ ] Sam: Improve cable management
- [ ] Josh: Update Github

#### Week 4 Review
* Quadrant 3 has been completed
